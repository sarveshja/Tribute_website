                            <p>         E V Ramaswamy, known as Periyar, is Tamil Nadu’s famous social reformer. His father was a rich businessman in Erode,
                                Tamil Nadu.  He grew up in a pious  Vaishnavite family, listening to Hindu scriptures from his childhood. At the 
                                young age of 25, he went on a pilgrimage to Kasi to visit the temple of Lord Kasi Viswanath</p>

                                History of Periyar
                            </h3>
                            <p>         Erode Venkata Ramasamy was born on 17 September 1879 to a Kannada
                                Balija merchant family in Erode, then a part of the Coimbatore 
                                district of the Madras Presidency. Ramasamy's father was Venkatappa 
                                Nayakar (or Venkata), and his mother was Chinnathyee, Muthammal. 
                                He had one elder brother named Krishnaswamy and two sisters named Kannamma 
                                and Ponnuthoy. He later came to be known as "Periyar" meaning 'respected 
                                one' or 'elder' in the Tamil.</p>
                                <br>
                                <p>     Ramasamy married when he was 19, and had a daughter who lived for only 
                                5 months. His first wife, Nagammai, died in 1933. Ramasamy married for 
                                a second time in July 1948. His second wife, Maniammai, continued Ramasamy's 
                                social work after his death in 1973, and his ideas then were advocated by 
                                Dravidar Kazhagam.</p>
                                <br>                    
                                <p>      In 1929, Ramasamy announced the deletion of his caste title Naicker from his name 
                                at the First Provincial Self-Respect Conference of Chengalpattu.
                                He could speak two Dravidian languages: Kannada and Tamil. Ramasamy attended 
                                school for five years after which he joined his father's trade at the 
                                age of 12. He used to listen to Tamil Vaishnavite gurus who gave discourses 
                                in his house enjoying his father's hospitality. At a young age, he began 
                                questioning the apparent contradictions in the Hindu mythological stories. 
                                As Ramasamy grew, he felt that people used religion only as a mask to deceive 
                                innocent people and therefore took it as one of his duties in life to 
                                warn people against superstitions and priests.</p>

                            <h3>Kashi Pilgrimage Incident</h3>
                            <p>           In 1904, Ramasamy went on a pilgrimage to Kashi 
                                to visit the revered Shiva temple of Kashi 
                                Vishwanath. Though regarded as one of the holiest 
                                sites of Hinduism, he witnessed immoral activities 
                                such as begging, and floating dead bodies.[16] His 
                                frustrations extended to functional Hinduism in 
                                general when he experienced what he called Brahmanic 
                                exploitation.</p>

                                <p>         However, one particular incident in Kasi had a profound 
                                    impact on Ramasamy's ideology and future work. At 
                                    the worship site there were free meals offered to guests. 
                                    To Ramasamy's shock, he was refused meals at choultries, 
                                    which exclusively fed Brahmins. Due to extreme hunger, 
                                    Ramasamy felt compelled to enter one of the eateries 
                                    disguised as a Brahmin with a sacred thread on his bare 
                                    chest, but was betrayed by his moustache. The gatekeeper 
                                    at the temple concluded that Ramasamy was not a Brahmin, 
                                    as Brahmins were not permitted by the Hindu shastras to 
                                    have moustaches. He not only prevented Ramasamy's entry 
                                    but also pushed him rudely into the street.</p>
                                
                                <p>            As his hunger became intolerable, Ramasamy was forced to 
                                    feed on leftovers from the streets. Around this time, 
                                    he realised that the eatery which had refused him entry 
                                    was built by a wealthy non-Brahmin from South India. 
                                    This discriminatory attitude dealt a blow to Ramasamy's 
                                    regard for Hinduism, for the events he had witnessed at 
                                    Kasi were completely different from the picture of Kasi 
                                    he had in mind, as a holy place which welcomed all.[16] 
                                    Ramasamy was a theist until his visit to Kasi, after 
                                    which his views changed and he became an atheist</p>

                            <h3>Self Respect Movement</h3>
                            <p>             Ramasamy and his followers campaigned constantly to influence 
                                and pressure the government to take measures to remove social 
                                inequality (abolish untouchability, manual scavenging system etc.), 
                                even while other nationalist forerunners focused on the struggle 
                                for political independence. The Self-Respect Movement was described 
                                from the beginning as "dedicated to the goal of giving non-Brahmins a 
                                sense of pride based on their Dravidian past"</p>
                            <p>             In 1952, the Ramasamy Self-Respect Movement Institution 
                                was registered with a list of objectives of the institution from which 
                                may be quoted as</p>

                                Minister of Madras Presidency, he introduced Hindi as a 
                                compulsory language of study in schools, thereby igniting a 
                                series of anti-Hindi agitations.[10] Tamil nationalists, 
                                the Justice Party under Sir A. T. Panneerselvam, and Ramasamy 
                                organised anti-Hindi protests in 1938 which ended with numerous 
                                arrests by the Rajaji government.</p>

                                <p>During the same year, the slogan "Tamil Nadu for Tamilians" 
                                    was first used by Ramasamy in protest against the introduction 
                                    of Hindi in schools. He claimed that the introduction of Hindi was 
                                    a dangerous mechanism used by the Aryans to infiltrate Dravidian 
                                    culture.[43] He reasoned that the adoption of Hindi would make Tamils 
                                    subordinate to the Hindi-speaking North Indians. Ramasamy claimed 
                                    that Hindi would not only halt the progress of Tamil people, but 
                                    would also completely destroy their culture and nullify the 
                                    progressive ideas that had been successfully inculcated through 
                                    Tamil in the recent decades.</p>
                                
                                <p>Cutting across party lines, South Indian politicians rallied together 
                                    in their opposition to Hindi.[44] There were recurrent anti-Hindi 
                                    agitations in 1948, 1952 and 1965.[45]</p>

                            <h3>As President of the Justice Party (1938–1944)</h3>
                            <p>A political party known as the South Indian Libertarian 
                                Federation (commonly referred to as Justice Party) was 
                                founded in 1916, principally to oppose the economic and 
                                political power of the Brahmin groups. The party's goal \
                                was to render social justice to the non-Brahmin groups. 
                                To gain the support of the masses, non-Brahmin politicians 
                                began propagating an ideology of equality among non-Brahmin 
                                castes. Brahmanical priesthood and Sanskritic social class-value 
                                hierarchy were blamed for the existence of inequalities 
                                among non-Brahmin caste groups.

                                <p>In 1937, when the government required that Hindi be taught in 
                                the school system, Ramasamy organised opposition to this policy 
                                through the Justice Party. After 1937, the Dravidian movement 
                                derived considerable support from the student community. In 
                                later years, opposition to Hindi played a big role in the 
                                politics of Tamil Nadu. The fear of the Hindi language had 
                                its origin in the conflict between Brahmins and non-Brahmins. 
                                To the Tamils, acceptance of Hindi in the school system was a 
                                form of bondage. When the Justice Party weakened in the absence 
                                of mass support, Ramasamy took over the leadership of the party 
                                after being jailed for opposing Hindi in 1939.[46] Under 
                                his tutelage the party prospered, but the party's conservative 
                                members, most of whom were rich and educated, withdrew from 
                                active participation.[9]</p>

                            <h3>Women's Rights</h3>
                            <img src="./periyar4.jpg" alt="Image does not exist" id="srm_img">
                            <p>As a rationalist and ardent social reformer, Ramasamy advocated 
                                forcefully throughout his life that women should be given 
                                their legitimate position in society as the equals of men and 
                                that they should be given good education and have the right 
                                to property. He thought age and social customs was not a bar 
                                in marrying women. He was keen that women should realise their 
                                rights and be worthy citizens of their country.</p>

                                <p>Ramasamy fought against the orthodox traditions of marriage as 
                                    suppression of women in Tamil Nadu and throughout the Indian 
                                    sub-continent. Though arranged marriages were meant to enable 
                                    a couple to live together throughout life, it was manipulated 
                                    to enslave women.[57] Much worse was the practice of 
                                    child marriages practised throughout India at the time. It 
                                    was believed that it would be a sin to marry after puberty. 
                                    Another practice, which is prevalent today, is the dowry 
                                    system where the bride's family is supposed to give the husband 
                                    a huge payment for the bride. The purpose of this was to assist 
                                    the newly wedded couple financially, but in many instances 
                                    dowries were misused by bridegrooms. The outcome of this 
                                    abuse turned to the exploitation of the bride's parents wealth, 
                                    and in certain circumstances, lead to dowry deaths.[59] There 
                                    have been hundreds of thousands of cases where wives have been 
                                    murdered, mutilated, and burned alive because the father of 
                                    the bride was unable to make the dowry payment to the husband. 
                                    Ramasamy fiercely stood up against this abuse meted out against 
                                    women.</p> 
                                
                                <p>Women in India also did not have rights to their families' or 
                                    husbands' property. Ramasamy fought fiercely for this and 
                                    also advocated for women to have the right to separate or 
                                    divorce their husbands under reasonable circumstances. 
                                    While birth control remained taboo in society of Ramasamy's 
                                    time, he advocated for it not only for the health of women 
                                    and population control, but for the liberation of women.</p> 
                                
                                <p>He criticised the hypocrisy of chastity for women and argued 
                                    that it should either apply also to men, or not at all for 
                                    both genders.[62] While fighting against this, Ramasamy advocated 
                                    getting rid of the Devadasi system. In his view it was an 
                                    example of a list of degradations of women, attaching them to 
                                    temples for the entertainment of others, and as temple prostitutes. 
                                    Further, for the liberation of women, Ramasamy pushed for their 
                                    right to have an education and to join the armed services and the 
                                    police force.</p> 
                                
                                <p>According to biographer M.D. Gopalakrishnan, Ramasamy and his 
                                    movement achieved a better status for women in Tamil society. 
                                    Ramasamy held that, in matters of education and employment, 
                                    there should be no difference between men and women. Gopalakrishnan 
                                    states that Ramasamy's influence in the State departments 
                                    and even the Center made it possible for women to join police 
                                    departments and the army. Ramasamy also spoke out against child 
                                    marriage.[52</p>
